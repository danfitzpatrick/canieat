# Can I Eat?
An app to calculate and display alternative data from the Fitbit api

My weight loss program is based around having a certain calorie _deficit_ every day, not specific 'number' as a calorie goal. If you are more active one day, you can eat more and still maintain your deficit goal. Using a tracker is ideal for this since that's really the only way to measure your activity level from day to day.

To this end, I was always looking at the Fitbit app's current calorie burn amount and then, in my head, calculating and adding in the amount of calories that I would still burn from my Basal Metabolic Rate for the rest of the day. The question was, can I still eat and where will my deficit end up by day's end if I do?

So I decided to make a simple app that would automatically just add the BMR calories remaining in the day to the current calorie burn normally shown in the tracker. I'm also experimenting with adding in some guesstimated activity calories for the remaining time in the day, and some other things.

Also this opens the door for slicing the data lots of different ways, and showing or putting more emphasis on the numbers that I'm interested in.
